        2023/03/20 <br /> Testing testing... 1-2 1-2... <br /> RADICAL. Ok so, welcome to the Aedan's Ramblings board! This is kinda just a place for me to jot down my thoughts
        about life, the universe, and everything. Nah jkjk, but I will probably ramble on about project ideas, or just funny haha life things in general cuz why not? <br />
        My first tidbit on this site: am I working on this during an online calculus lecture? Absolutely. Normally I <i>would</i> be paying attention, but normally, calculus is in
        person and I am physically incapable of paying attention during online lectures. Learned that the hard way from high school, but such is life. I also have a CompSci assignment
        that I have been bouncing back and forth between with this because why not?<br /> Uhhhhhhhh I don't think I have anything else to say right now, so I guess bye bye for now lol
